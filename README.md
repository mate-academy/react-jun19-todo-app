# React ToDo App

This is a simple ToDo App that allows users to create new tasks, mark them as complete or incomplete, and delete them. It also provides functionality to toggle all tasks as complete or incomplete, switch between different types of tasks, and remove completed tasks. Users can edit the task description and empty tasks will be automatically deleted. The app is built using React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and uses localStorage to store the task list for future reference.
